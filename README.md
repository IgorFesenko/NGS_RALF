The RNA-seq analysis of wild type and PpRALF3 knockout lines

To expand our understanding of the roles of PpRALFs in biotic stress response, we next sought to perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to compare transcriptome response of PpRALF3 KO and wild type plants during F. solani infection. Twelve paired-end RNA-Seq libraries were generated from three biological replicates of mock-inoculated and F. solani-infected wild type and PpRALF3 KO plants.
